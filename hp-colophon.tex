formatted by fans of the story, and built on
\today\ at \DTMcurrenttime.
The text was set in 
Huerta Tipografica's Alegreya type family.
Chapter headings were set in Lumos, inspired by
the display font used in the US editions of the Harry Potter books,
drawn by Sarah McFalls. 
The book was typeset using \LaTeX. The
artwork for the cover was created with the GIMP.  The source code for
