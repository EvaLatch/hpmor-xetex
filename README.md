# hpmor-xetex

This is a XeLaTeX version of Eliezer Yudkowsky's epic fanfiction _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_

The source for this version was duplicated from <http://github.com/rjl20/hpmor/master>.
Since then, it has been greatly reworked, with various improvements and stylistic changes.

Features:
* Includes an edited version of _Daystar's Remix of Rationality_ for chapters 1--4.
* Formatted in the style of the American editions of canon Harry Potter
* Text set in 11-point URW Garamond No. 8, chapter headings set in Lumos
* Individual .tex files for each chapter
* LaTeX formatting code restructured, pruned, and somewhat commented
* Outputs six PDF files for printing the story in six volumes
* Page size 9 in. by 6 in.
* Careful typography-- attention paid to line spacing, em dash, ellipsis, etc.
* Microtype protrusion for body text, extra letterspacing for Lumos
* Spellcheck removed a few persistent typos
* Standardization of dates, times, and capitalized words
* Removal of all Britpicks for consistent usage throughout all 122 chapters
* Removal of Omake files; chapter numbering restarts in each sub-book
* Large initial capitals at the start of each chapter with lettrine
* Manual linebreaks in long chapter titles (quite the hack)
* Fancy headers, footers, and section breaks
